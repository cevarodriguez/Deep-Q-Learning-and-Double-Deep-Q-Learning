# The goal of this project was to solve the Mpuntain Car and CartPole environments of Open AI Gym using Q Learning and Deep Q Learning.

Both algorithms were implemented based on these papers:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf (Deep Q Learning)
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf (Double Deep Q Learning)

Further details are detailed on the notebook itself but the steps are fairly straightforward:

. Replay memory implementation for past state transitions

. Model implementation

. Agent implementation (in charge of interacting with the environment and training the models)

. Training

. Video rendering for visualization

. Data plotting for comparison and conclusions
